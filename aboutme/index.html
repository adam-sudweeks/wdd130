    <h2>Adam Sudweeks</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Adam Sudweeks, and I live in Washington Terrace, Utah. </p>
    <p>I chose Applied Technology as my degree to start, but will change it accordingly to what I like.
        <p> I'm excited to learn, and for the opportunities the future has for all of us. I love to bbq, hike, and enjoy
            time with family. I'm currently working full time, doing school, and family ties me up for most of the time.</p>
